 Credit Risk Analysis Report

1. An overview of the analysis: The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of a logistic regression model in predicting loan statuses, specifically distinguishing between "healthy(0)" and "high-risk(1)" loans. Accurate prediction of loan statuses is crucial for risk assessment and decision-making. 

2. The results:
 -Accuracy Score:  the model achieves an accuracy of 99%, indicating that it correctly predicts loan statuses with very high accuracy.

- Precision Score: For class 0 (healthy loan), the precision is 1.00, indicating that all instances predicted as class 0 were correct. For class 1 (high-risk loan), the precision is 0.84, meaning that 84% of the instances predicted as class 1 were correct.

- Recall Score: For class 0 (healthy loan), the recall is 0.99, indicating that the model correctly identified 99% of all actual class 0 instances. For class 1 (high-risk loan), the recall is 0.99, meaning that the model correctly identified 99% of all actual class 1 instances.

    
3. summary: I highly recommend using this logistic regression model for predicting loan statuses. It demonstrates accuracy, and precision in classifying both "healthy" and "high-risk" loans.
